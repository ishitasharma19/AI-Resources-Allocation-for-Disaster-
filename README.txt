The project contains three different code files for three different scenarios. The code files further contain two main code parts, Q-learning and Deep Q Leaning. 
The results obtained from the runs are all being printed.
Simply python runs would suffice to produce the results.

The results excel sheet contains the results obtained for some runs for Q learning and Deep Q Learning for the different scenarios
